# Quick Start
[Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles), often used to represent rigid body rotations in 3D, 
can be defined in many different ways. 

The world of transformations is filled with 
[ambiguities](https://rock-learning.github.io/pytransform3d/transformation_ambiguities.html) which can make it harder 
than necessary to interface softwares which define their transformations differently.

`eulerangles` is designed to simplify the handling of large sets of 
Euler angles in Python.

Functions are provided for arbitrary conversions of Euler angles into rotation matrices, rotation matrices into
euler angles and conversion between differently defined Euler angles.
